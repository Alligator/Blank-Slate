Blank Slate

  Gonna be a blank slate,
  Gonna wear a white cape

  Blank slate is a tiny wrapper around the html5 canvas, just to cut down on the
  boilerplate in my own personal projects. It doesn't do anything fancy, it's
  just to save me time and effort.

  If you find this useful too that's cool.
